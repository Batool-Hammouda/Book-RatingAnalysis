# Book-RatingAnalysis
This is the second project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The main aim is to practice and display data wrangling skills, such as gathering, assessing, and cleaning data using a real dataset.

The datasets used in this project:
- Books dataset: Contains metadata about books. It can be downloaded manually from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/somnambwl/bookcrossing-dataset?select=Books.csv
- Ratings dataset: Contains user ratings for books, gathered via an API.
  
After completing the data wrangling steps, exploratory analysis is performed to answer a research question defined in the problem statement section of the notebook.
